# Supacord - Supabase (postgresql) Database Visualiser
Supacord is a data visualiser platform designed to allow for massive datasets to be computed and visualised for your investigatory purposes, queryable through natural language.

We are aiming to massively simplify the process of investigating data, table relationships, using sophisticated search algorithms to identify relationships that may be contained
in non-foreign key columns, JSON data and more.

## Experimental
We are currently building Supacord, so nothing is really "demo-able" just yet, but we're super excited to be building this awesome tool.
