# Supacord - Supabase Database Visualiser & Investigator
Supacord is a database designed for realtime analysis and querying of your Supabase project, through natural language.

More will be written here soon, as the platform is currently under development.

# Platforms
Supacord is planning on being hosted as a web application, and executables for both Windows and MacOS. This allows you to interface with the platform from any major device,
so that you do not need to have another tab open to be able to perform your dynamic analytics.
